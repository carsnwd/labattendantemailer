# Description
This is a program I wrote that would automate an email I had to send over and over.

I work as a lab attendant in the computer labs on my campus, and whenever a person leaves something in the lab I have
to email them saying the left it. Instead of writing out this email every single time, I decided to just write a script
that writes it for me except I fill in a few blanks.

# To do
## GUI
    -Handle when user inputs nothing
    -Add handling of bad input
    -Make it look pretty
    -Remove the lab attendant email and password unless figure out how to work it with ship email (need to contact Jamie or networking at school)

## SendEmail
    -Capitalize the first letter of the item so "Flash drive left in MCT054" instead of "flash drive left in MCT054" in subject
