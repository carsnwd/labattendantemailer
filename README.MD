# Description
This is a program I wrote that would automate an email I had to send over and over.

I work as a lab attendant in the computer labs on my campus, and whenever a person leaves something in the lab I have
to email them saying the left it. Instead of writing out this email every single time, I decided to just write a script
that writes it for me except I fill in a few blanks.

# To do
    -Handle when user inputs nothing
    -Add handling of bad input
    -Make it look pretty
    -Setup new email with @ship.edu with SMTP with Jamie
    -Make it a .exe executable file. http://www.pyinstaller.org/
