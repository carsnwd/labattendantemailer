==DESCRIPTION==
This is a program I wrote that would automate an email I had to send over and over.

I work as a lab attendant in the computer labs on my campus, and whenever a person leaves something in the lab I have
to email them saying the left it. Instead of writing out this email every single time, I decided to just write a script
that writes it for me except I fill in a few blanks.

==TO DO==
-GUI
    -Handle when user inputs nothing
    -Handle when user enters invalid emails
    -Make it look pretty

None of the email part has been made yet.
